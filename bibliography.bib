	abstract = {Beautifully preserved, nearly complete theropod skeletons from Alberta (Canada) allow re−evaluation of the taxonomic status of North American tyrannosaurids. It is concluded that the most parsimonious interpretation of relationships leads to the separation of the two species of Albertosaurus (sensu Russell 1970) into Gorgosaurus libratus from the Campanian Dinosaur Park Formation and Albertosaurus sarcophagus from the upper Campanian/lower Maastrichtian Horseshoe Canyon Formation. Albertosaurus and Gorgosaurus are closely related, but can be distinguished from each other by more characters than are known to justify generic distinction within another tyrannosaurid clade that includes Daspletosaurus, Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus. Daspletosaurus is known from multiple species that cover extensive geographic, eco− logical and temporal ranges, and it is sensible to maintain its generic distinction from Tyrannosaurus. All tyrannosaurid species have consistent ontogenetic trends. However, one needs to be cautious in assessing ontogenetic stage because many characters are size−dependent rather than age−dependent. There are relatively few osteological differences that can distinguish tyrannosaurid species at any age. For example, Nanotyrannus lancensis is probably a distinct species from Tyrannosaurus rex because there is no evidence of ontogenetic reduction of tooth counts in any other tyrannosaurid spe− cies. Some characters that are good for separating mature tyrannosaurids, such as differences in the sizes and shapes of maxillary fenestrae, are not useful for identifying the species of juveniles.},

This subdivision, based on combined outcrop and subsurface analyses, reflects lithostratigraphic variations related to changes in sea level (previously recognized) and newly documented changes in climate, volcanism, and orogenesis in an evolving foreland basin. Million-year-scale cycles of orogenesis resulted in changes in sediment supply and rates of subsidence in the basin and are interpreted in the context of a simple, two-phase foreland-basin sequence stratigraphic model: (i) overthrust loading resulting in reduced rates of sediment supply and subsidence in the most distal portions of the Alberta foredeep (our field area); (ii) tectonic quiescence leading to increased rates of sediment supply and subsidence during proximal-foredeep rebound. During the first ∼2.5 Ma of its history (Strathmore and Drumheller members), the {HCFm} was tectonically and climatically “stable”, and depositional style and stratigraphic architecture were influenced by vertical aggradation and modest progradation of shorelines. During the remaining ∼4.5 Ma (Horsethief, Morrin, Tolman, Carbon, and Whitemud members), there were more complex and frequent changes in climate, volcanism, orogenesis, landscape weathering, and soil formation. Understanding this previously unrecognized complexity is critical for correctly assessing hydrocarbon resource distributions and biostratigraphic and taphonomic patterns.},

	abstract = {Intraspecific aggression, or agonism, is a widespread intrasexual selective behavior important to understanding animal behavioral ecology and reproductive systems. Such behavior can be studied either by direct observation or inferred from wound/scar frequency in extant species but is difficult to document in extinct taxa, limiting understanding of its evolution. Among extant archosaurs, crocodylians display extensive intrasexual aggression, whereas birds show extreme visual/vocal intersexual display. The evolutionary origin of this behavioral divergence, and pattern in non-avian dinosaurs, is unknown. Here we document the morphology, frequency, and ontogeny of intraspecific facial bite lesions (324 lesions) in a large sample of tyrannosaurids (202 specimens, 528 elements) to infer patterns of intraspecific aggression in non-avian theropods. Facial scars are consistent in position and orientation across tyrannosaurid species, suggesting bites were inflicted due to repeated/postured behavior. Facial scars are absent in young tyrannosaurids, first appear in immature animals (∼50\% adult skull length), are present in ∼60\% of the adult-sized specimens, and show aggressor:victim size isometry. The ontogenetic distribution of bite scars suggests agonistic behavior is associated with the onset of sexual maturity, and scar presence in approximately half the specimens may relate to a sexual pattern. Considered in a phylogenetic context, intraspecific bite marks are consistent and widely distributed in fossil and extant crocodyliforms and non-maniraptoriform theropods, suggesting a potential plesiomorphic behavior in archosaurs. Their absence in maniraptoriform theropods, including birds, may reflect a transition from boney cranial ornamentation and crocodylian-like intrasexual aggression to avian-like intersexual display with the evolution of pennaceous feathers.},

	abstract = {A high-resolution biostratigraphic analysis of 287 dinosaurian macrofossils and 138 bonebeds in the Edmonton Group (Upper Cretaceous) of southern Alberta provides evidence for at least three dinosaurian assemblage zones in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation ({HCFm}). From bottom to top the zones comprise unique assemblages of ornithischians and are named as follows: 1) Edmontosaurus regalis-Pachyrhinosaurus canadensis (lower zone); 2) Hypacrosaurus altispinus-Saurolophus osborni (middle zone); and 3) Eotriceratops xerinsularis (upper zone). Whereas the lower and middle zones are well-defined and based on abundant specimens, the validity of the uppermost zone (E. xerinsularis) is tentative because it is based on a single specimen and the absence of dinosaur taxa from lower in section. The transition from the lower to the middle zone coincides with the replacement of a warm-and-wet saturated deltaic setting by a cooler, coastal-plain landscape, characterized by seasonal rainfall and better-drained substrates. Whereas changes in rainfall and substrate drainage appear to have influenced the faunal change, changes in mean annual temperature and proximity to shoreline appear to have had little influence on faunal change. We speculate that the faunal change between the middle and upper zones also resulted from a change in climate, with ornithischian dinosaurs responding to the re-establishment of wetter-and-warmer climates and poorly-drained substrates. Compared with the shorter-duration and climaticallyconsistent dinosaurian assemblage zones in the older Dinosaur Park Formation of southern Alberta, {HCFm} assemblage zones record long-term morphological stasis in dinosaurs. Furthermore, the coincidence of faunal and paleoenvironmental changes in the {HCFm} suggest climate-change-driven dinosaur migrations into and out of the region.},

Albertosaurus, other vertebrates, and trees are concentrated on upper point bar surfaces of a small meandering paleochannel. Throughout the field area, Albertosaurus, other vertebrates, and coalified plants are also preserved patchily in overbank mudstones at the same horizon. Although the bonebed is dominated by Albertosaurus, there are also sparse macrofossil remains of Hypacrosaurus and Albertonykus. The basal lag yields vertebrate microfossils containing at least 19 additional taxa. Freshwater invertebrates are preserved at and below the base of the paleochannel. Large elements are over represented at the site, whereas smaller elements are under represented, suggesting hydraulic sorting. The taphonomic signature of the site suggests that death, disarticulation, and burial took place within one year. We conclude that one or more storms of large intensity downed trees and temporarily drowned the paleolandscape, ultimately killing the tyrannosaurids directly or indirectly. Logs and carcasses were reworked on a point bar during the waning stages of the storm and over subsequent years. Scavenging and breakage of remains by large carnivores was probably inhibited by the mixed log and bone jam. Remains of smaller scavengers (small theropods and snails) are plentiful suggesting these forms were more successful at accessing remains. Juvenile Albertosaurus are under represented at the site suggesting the possibility of age segregation. Because the group of Albertosaurus may have been forced together by rising floodwaters, it is not possible to assess the degree to which the taxon was gregarious from these data alone.},

Limited reproducibility among different vintages of K–Ar and 40Ar/39Ar ages inhibited the development of a high-resolution chronostratigraphy. Here, we employ and further test a recently completed U–Pb geochronology and associated age-stratigraphy model to update temporal constraints on the Park’s bentonites, formational contacts, and other markers. In turn, we document rock accumulation rates and calibrate ages and durations of informal megaherbivore dinosaur assemblage zones and other biozones. Weighted mean 206 Pb/238 U ages from five bentonites range from 76.718 ± 0.020 to 74.289 ± 0.014 Ma (2σ internal uncertainties) through an interval of 88.75 m, indicating a duration of ∼2.43 Myr and an overall rock accumulation rate of 3.65 ± 0.04 cm/ka. An increase in rate above the Oldman–Dinosaur Park formational contact conforms to a regionally expressed pattern of increased accommodation at ∼76.3 Ma across Alberta and Montana. Palynological biozone data suggest a condensed section/hiatus in the uppermost portion of the Oldman Formation. Dinosaur assemblage zones exhibit durations of ∼700–600 kyr and are significantly shorter than those in the overlying Horseshoe Canyon Formation. A decreased rate in dinosaur assemblage turnovers in the last eight million years of the Mesozoic in western Canada may be explained by withdrawal of the Western Interior Seaway and the expansion of ecologically homogenous lowlands in its wake.},

All of the localities sampled were deposited during a cool, dry climate at a palaeolatitude of ∼58°N. Thus, these assemblages provide insight into a northern cool-climate assemblage in the early Maastrichtian of western North America. This fauna is characterized by the presence of taxa with more northern affinities, such as Holostean A, champsosaurs, Troodon, and toothed birds. Warm-climate taxa, such as crocodylians, large and diverse turtles, and albanerpetontids are notable in their absence. The Albertosaurus bonebed locality at the top of unit 4 of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation was deposited during the initial stages of a trend to a warmer and wetter climate that is represented in unit 5. The bonebed shares many taxa with the underlying vertebrate microfossil localities. However, a notable difference is the presence of Atrociraptor marshalli from the Albertosaurus bonebed but not the other localities in the upper Horseshoe Canyon Formation. The presence of Atrociraptor may be attributable to this change in climate rather than local ecological conditions. Also, the assemblages are different in the paucity of fish remains in the bonebed, and the relative rarity of shed hadrosaur teeth. The low abundance of aquatic taxa and rarity of shed teeth of hadrosaurs indicate that the locality is largely autochthonous, with little material being transported into the site.},

Since this initial report, the University of Alberta’s annual field work has continued to yield additional tyrannosaurid material from the Danek Bonebed. In addition to nearly 200 tyrannosaurid shed teeth, five diagnostic tyrannosaurid cranial and postcranial bones have been identified to date. Three cranial bones were included in the initial description; here the newly uncovered left and right tyrannosaurid pubes ({UALVP} 52709 and {UALVP} 56262 respectively) are described and mapped in relation to the previously known material. The pubes can be confidently diagnosed as tyrannosaurid based on a posterior bow of the pubic shaft and further classified as albertosaurine by a weakly expanded obturator plate. A. sarcophagus is the only tyrannosaurid and albertosaurine known from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, which allows for the material to be confidently assigned to this taxon. The left pubis ({UALVP} 52709) possesses multiple tooth traces on the medial surface that were likely made post-mortem as the medial surface of the pubis would have been deep within the body cavity of the animal and reactive (healing) bone is absent. Given the numerous large gouge-like tooth traces on the medial surface of the pubis and the abundance of cf. Albertosaurus teeth from the bonebed it seems likely that an A. sarcophagus took this opportunity to feed on a conspecific; providing evidence for the first case of cannibalism from an albertosaurine.},

Discovery of several giant, high-fidelity ichnites in series from the Morrin Member represents the first definitive dinosaur trackway reported from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation. The trackway is composed of three footprint casts in series, alongside 22 associated ichnites. The ichnites were formed in soft sediment molds along a non-uniform walking surface. The deep substrates allowed for the preservation of both the plantar surface and dorsal components of the trackmakers’ feet. Some ichnites show soft tissue morphologies like interdigital webbing, toe pads, and skin impressions. Presence of these features and small kidney-shaped forelimb prints allow referral to Hadrosauropodus langstoni. The preservation of the trackway demonstrates asymmetries useful for comparison of the relief and impression surfaces of prints using both discrete and morphometric characteristics, improving confidence in identifying partial or isolated Hadrosauropodus prints of various modes of formation.},

However, its microvertebrate paleocommunity structure is relatively poorly known, partly because it lacks the abundant microsites of other Upper Cretaceous deposits of Alberta. An unusual microsite ({FTS}-2) from the Horsethief Member of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation is described that produces abundant anuran and troodontid material, alongside perinatal material from ornithischians and tyrannosaurs. Anuran specimens representing a minimum of two separate taxa and a metatherian molar suggest that these components of the fauna were more diverse than currently recognized. The assemblage is similar to three other North American sites that produce abundant troodontid teeth alongside perinatal dinosaurs. However, environmental and taphonomic conditions of these sites vary, supporting the notion of mixed biotic and abiotic factors driving the association of troodontids alongside perinates. In part, this may stem from similar nesting preferences between troodontids and other dinosaurs, as material collected from all three sites suggests proximity to troodontid nesting sites. Sites such as {FTS}-2 are important for revealing the rare and small components of paleoecosystems, and hold promise for revealing interactions between these parts of the fauna.},

All but one of the seven trackways attributed to hatchling tyrannosaurids occur as codirectional, equally spaced pairs, but one pair walked in the opposite direction, albeit parallel, to the other two. The pair of ornithomimid trackways also appears to represent two animals walking at the same speed, in the same direction, and turning together.

	abstract = {Background Fossil tracks made by non-avian theropod dinosaurs commonly reflect the habitual bipedal stance retained in living birds. Only rarely-captured behaviors, such as crouching, might create impressions made by the hands. Such tracks provide valuable information concerning the often poorly understood functional morphology of the early theropod forelimb. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we describe a well-preserved theropod trackway in a Lower Jurassic (∼198 million-year-old) lacustrine beach sandstone in the Whitmore Point Member of the Moenave Formation in southwestern Utah. The trackway consists of prints of typical morphology, intermittent tail drags and, unusually, traces made by the animal resting on the substrate in a posture very similar to modern birds. The resting trace includes symmetrical pes impressions and well-defined impressions made by both hands, the tail, and the ischial callosity. Conclusions/Significance The manus impressions corroborate that early theropods, like later birds, held their palms facing medially, in contrast to manus prints previously attributed to theropods that have forward-pointing digits. Both the symmetrical resting posture and the medially-facing palms therefore evolved by the Early Jurassic, much earlier in the theropod lineage than previously recognized, and may characterize all theropods.},

	abstract = {Depositional cycles in fluvial successions are described here as chronostratigraphic packages of strata founded on a laterally extensive, scour-based, amalgamated channel-sand body, overlain by mudrocks, isolated channel fills, avulsion and splay complexes, and paleosols. Ten packages are described from the lower Horseshoe Canyon Formation (Campanian-Maastrichtian), one of a succession of clastic wedges filling the Alberta foreland basin in south-central Alberta. The structure of these packages is consistent with the fall-rise-fall cycle of base-level described in other studies, but the package-bounding scours and internal surfaces are discontinuous and difficult to trace in the mudrock-dominated strata. Terrestrial vertebrate fossils are preserved in relatively fossiliferous, facies-independent horizons 1 to 3 m thick that statistically correlate with the stratigraphic position of package scours and surfaces. Fossiliferous horizons formed as a result of attritional accumulation under an optimum, relatively low, regional deposition rate. Not only do these horizons aid in locating package surfaces, but they also provide insight to the interaction of the package-scale, base-level oscillation with the larger-scale fluctuation in accommodation associated with the formation of the clastic wedge. As such, fossiliferous horizons in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation make better boundary markers than do paleosols, splays, coal seams, or even the surfaces associated with package structure. Therefore, the vertebrate fossil record may supply a means of stratigraphically evaluating sections in other locations in which typical sedimentological and architectural cues for surfaces are absent.},

	abstract = {Although considerable work has been conducted on the stratigraphy and dinosaur assemblages of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation of southern Alberta, equivalent strata and assemblages in central Alberta remain poorly understood. Data from the Danek Bonebed (Edmonton, Alberta) are beginning to fill this gap. The bonebed occurs 4 m above the \#9 Big Island Coal Seam. This stratigraphic position lies just below the middle of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation in the Edmonton region, and also lies below a thick, stratigraphically significant non-coaly interval that is expressed throughout central and southern Alberta. The stratigraphic position of the Danek Bonebed equates best with the uppermost Horsethief Member of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation in the Drumheller region and the upper part of Unit 4 of the Wapiti Formation in the Grande Prairie region. In both Drumheller and Grande Prairie, the correlated position of the bonebed underlies a zone of marine transgression (Drumheller Marine Tongue), which, in turn, includes the Campanian–Maastrichtian boundary. In the context of Geologic Time Scale 2004, we infer a late Campanian age of 71.0–71.3 Ma for the bonebed. The Danek’s dinosaurian assemblage is limited taxonomically, but compares well with the Edmontosaurus regalis – Pachyrhinosaurus canadensis fossil assemblage zone in the Drumheller region. We propose that a mega-herbivore faunal assemblage, characterized by Edmontosaurus and Pachyrhinosaurus, extended continuously across the climatically wet coastal plain of latest Campanian southern and central Alberta, and likely extended northwest into the North Slope of Alaska, where it persisted into the early Maastrichtian.},

Eight pedotypes representing hydromorphic, moderately-drained and well-drained paleosols were recognized. When considered within their stratigraphic context, these paleosols show that palaeoenvironmental and palaeoclimatic changes occurred either gradually between major lithological subdivisions of the {HCFm} or relatively rapidly within subdivisions. Hydromorphic paleosols, predominant in the coal-bearing stratigraphic interval at the base of the {HCFm}, were gradually replaced by well-drained paleosols in the overlying coal-poor interval. While climate remained warm and humid during this change in soil drainage conditions, mean annual temperature and precipitation dropped rapidly higher in section, shortly prior to the Campanian–Maastrichtian boundary, without concomitant lithological or pedological changes. A brief return of poorly-drained paleosols in the middle of the {HCFm} coincides with a regional marine transgression (Drumheller Marine Tongue). Well-drained palaeoenvironments, associated with a warm and dry climate, persisted through the upper part of the {HCFm} until a gradual return to poorly-drained conditions and to a warm, humid climate occurred at the top of the formation. An important decline in turtle diversity through the {HCFm}, previously attributed to climate, is shown to coincide instead with changes in soil drainage conditions, where aridity, landscape instability, and migratory barriers possibly acted as secondary limiting factors to faunal recovery.},

	abstract = {Our understanding of caenagnathids has benefited from recent discoveries, including nearly complete skeletons from the Hell Creek Formation of Montana. However, their phylogenetic relationships remain unclear. A new specimen from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation of Alberta has implications for the phylogeny and paleobiology of these creatures. The partial skeleton is articulated and includes a mandible, a full cervical and dorsal series of vertebrae, a right pectoral girdle and arm, a sternum, gastralia, a partial ilium, and a partial hind limb. The mandible is edentulous and the articular ridge is intermediate in form between Caenagnathus collinsi and Chirostenotes pergracilis. The neck is long and composed of at least 11 well-pneumatized cervical vertebrae with fused cervical ribs. The dorsal ribs have finger-like uncinate processes dissimilar in shape to those of other oviraptorosaurs. The pectoral girdle is large and typically maniraptoran, except that the glenoid of the scapulocoracoid faces laterally instead of posteroventrally. The arm is well muscled and can be interpreted to have been a pennibrachium, as indicated by ulnar papillae on the ulna. The manus is characterized by a short first metacarpal but an elongate phalanx I-1 and oviraptorid-like phalangeal proportions in the second digit. These and other features indicate that the specimen represents a new taxon, Apatoraptor pennatus, gen. et sp. nov. Phylogenetic analysis resolves the complicated relationships of Caenagnathidae and allows the evolution of display features to be traced throughout Oviraptorosauria. http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:122957D7-F65F-4A2C-86AF-386AE8AAF2C4 {SUPPLEMENTAL} {DATA}—Supplemental materials are available for this article for free at www.tandfonline.com/{UJVP} Citation for this article: Funston, G.

	abstract = {Three monodominant hadrosaurid bonebeds in the Horsethief Member of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation (uppermost Campanian) in southern Alberta, Canada, are documented. Each bonebed is hosted by a decimetre-thick deposit of poorly sorted and graded organic-fragment-rich mudstone. These fossil deposits are interpreted as having been carried and deposited by debris flows or hyperconcentrated mass sediment flows initiated by overbank flooding from local channels. Each bonebed is dominated ({\textgreater}50\% of identifiable elements) by the disarticulated to occasionally associated remains of hadrosaurine hadrosaurids, inferred to be Edmontosaurus regalis. The majority of hadrosaurid elements at two of the sites (Bleriot Ferry and Prehistoric Park) are from large, presumably adult-sized individuals, whereas the majority of elements from the Fox Coulee site are from subadults and juveniles. Fossil elements from all the sites exhibit similar taphonomic signatures suggestive of a high degree of biostratinomic modification including: (i) thorough disarticulation of carcasses, (ii) a large amount of breakage, (iii) modest amounts of size sorting, and (iv) minimum to modest occurrences of abrasion, and scratch and tooth marks. These signatures indicate that carcasses were exposed for significant amounts of time on the floodplain, where they rotted, were scavenged and trampled, and were exposed to moving water prior to final burial. The size of each bonebed together with the density of bones suggest that the biocoenoses comprised large groups of hadrosaurids, and bone size distributions suggest the possibility of age-segregated populations. The monodominant nature of the assemblages combined with homogenous taphonomic signatures within and between sites suggests that these bonebed assemblages are best interpreted as the result of mass kills rather than attrition, with recurring tropical storm-induced coastal-plain flooding postulated as a likely mechanism for what killed and eventually buried these dinosaurs.},

This report provides a brief synthesis of the literature and current concepts for the Horseshoe Canyon Formation Strata. The objective was to present a regional stratigraphic analysis integrating outcrop measurements and subsurface log correlations. In particular, a series of outcrop measured sections and nearby subsurface well cross-sections were studied to better understand the regional stratigraphy, sedimentology and resource potential of the sandy upper Campanian-Maastrichtian strata of southern Alberta. The upper boundary of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation was formally revised to better reflect recent data and understanding. A more recognizable stratigraphic subdivision for the strata was delineated . The paper also describes and interprets the general facies that recur throughout the formations, and establishes a regional stratigraphic framework based on the inter-tonguing of marine and non marine units. The ultimate objective of the study was to reduce risk in exploration and exploitation of these resources. refs., tabs., figs.},

Ammonites and inoceramids exhibit distinct stable-isotope values: inoceramids have higher δ13C values (0.6‰ to 5.0‰) and lower δ18O values (−4.0‰ to −2.8‰), whereas coeval baculitid ammonites have lower δ13C values (−4.8‰ to −0.3‰) and higher δ18O values (−2.3‰ to 0.0‰), with other ammonites having stable-isotope values ranging between the baculitids and inoceramids. The isotopic composition of the inoceramids and ammonites are unlikely due to kinetic or vital effects because species from open ocean environments have values expected from marine water and there is no correlation between the δ13C and δ18O values of the inceramids as has been reported for modern foraminifers and calcareous algae suspected of exerting vital effects. The heterogeneity in stable-isotope values of coeval molluscs implies that the Bearpaw Sea was isotopically stratified. Isotopic exchange between the water and sediments, and the formation of 18O-depleted deepwater mass by mixing of Tethyan and Boreal waters in the {WIS}, may have caused such isotopic stratification.},

	abstract = {Otophysans, known for their enhanced hearing enabled by the complex Weberian apparatus, comprise two-thirds of extant freshwater fish species. Previously, they were thought to have originated in fresh water before the breakup of Pangea, implying a nearly 80-million-year gap between the origin and oldest known fossil. However, the discovery of a Late Cretaceous freshwater otophysan challenges this view. Integrating fossil, morphological, and genomic data, we estimate a younger crown group origin of {\textasciitilde}154 million years ago. Notably, ancestral range and habitat reconstructions indicate marine origins for the otophysan crown groups, with at least two transitions to fresh water. Functional simulations of the Weberian ossicles of this fossil suggest that the distinctive hearing capabilities of otophysans evolved in conjunction with fusion of hearing ossicle parts and freshwater adaptations.},

	abstract = {The Late Cretaceous of Alberta preserves one of the most complete records of fossil turtles within a single geographic area in North America. The Cenomanian Dunvegan Formation contains the earliest record of the family Trionychidae in North America. The Santonian Milk River Formation contains a minimum of ten taxa with Adocus, a small trionychid, and a member of the Solemydidae being the most abundant. Diversity remains high in the mid-Campanian Judith River Group. The solemyidid last occurs in the basal beds of the Judith River Group. A member of the Macrobaenidae first occurs in the Dinosaur Park Formation, the uppermost formation in the Judith River Group. Turtles diversity is low in the late Campanian lower Horseshoe Canyon Formation, and they are absent in the early Maastrichtian upper Horseshoe Canyon Formation. Diversity increases in the late Maastrichtian Scollard Formation, although it is much less than in the contemporaneous Hell Creek Formation of Montana. Two of the taxa present in the Scollard Formation, Compsemys and Plastomenus, occur in late Campanian or early Maastrichtian formations in more southerly areas of North America. The changes in turtle diversity through the Campanian and Maastrichtian are interpreted as a result of shifts in a latitudinal turtle diversity gradient resulting from changes in climate. Based on this interpretation a decrease in temperature from the mid-Campanian to early Maastrichtian, followed by a rapid increase at the beginning of the late Maastrichtian is supported.},

The palynomorph recovery from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation and overlying units documents a number of significant events that allow the subdivision of the section. The Albertosaurus bonebed occurs within the lower Maastrichtian portion of the Edmonton Group. The bonebed is situated just below the base of the Scollardia trapaformis Palynomorph Zone, an important marker assemblage that has been documented from areas of the Yukon, Northwest Territories, Alberta, and Saskatchewan. This indicates that the bonebed lies at the top of the Mancicorpus vancampoi Zone. The transition between the zones is marked by a colour change in the sediments, the appearance of coals and organic-rich sediments above the transition, a decrease in numbers of vertebrate fossils, and the appearance of new pollen species. It is inferred that the observed changes reflect a climatic switch from dry to wetter conditions. At a large scale, palynomorph assemblages across this transition do not clearly indicate marked differences that can be attributed to the climatic change, with the exception of the appearance of Scollardia trapaformis and Mancicorpus gibbus in the assemblages. On a microscale of a few metres, there are changes in relative abundance of plant groups.},

Within this assemblage occur abundant stems, leafy shoots, leaves, ovuliferous cones, and pollen cone clusters that are here described as a new species of Cunninghamia. The stems have persistent leaf bases and plagiotropic branching. Some stems show several growth increments, and the cortex and pith are made up of resin canals, large parenchymatous cells, and lysigenous cavities. Leafy shoot axes have parenchymatous cells, resinous cells, lysigenous cavities, and resin canals within the cortex and pith. The leaves are helically arranged, lanceolate to falcate, with two abaxial stomatal bands, a large central resin canal, and two smaller lateral canals. The ovuliferous cones have numerous helically arranged bract scale complexes. The bracts and three-lobed ovuliferous scale are variously ornamented. Anatomical features of bracts include a well-defined hypodermal layer and resin canals with adaxial traces. A single vascular trace enters the complex and divides to produce the ovuliferous-scale trace and bract traces. Ovules/seeds are ovoid and weakly winged. The pollen cone–bearing branch apices show stalks of at least 17 pollen cones arranged in a pseudowhorl. Each stalk consists of an inflated base surrounded by 5–6 scale-like leaves. The anatomy and morphology of the fossil material agrees so closely with that of modern Cunninghamia that we are confident in describing it as a new species of this genus, Cunninghamia taylorii sp. nov. The present material provides a rare opportunity to contribute toward a better understanding of the specific variation, biology, ecology, and evolutionary history of cunninghamioid Cupressaceae.},

Its stratigraphic position places it near the end of the Campanian Stage of the Late Cretaceous Epoch, at an absolute age of approximately 72 million years before present. It is one of the few Cretaceous aroid fossils known at present, and it represents a new genus of Araceae, here named Albertarum. The infructescence is fertile to the apex, and the flowers must have been bisexual. Flowers bear remains of a long, attenuated style, surrounded by a perigone of six tepals. A fracture reveals ellipsoid seeds with a thick, ribbed testa and traces of a raphe, arranged in groups of three. The gynoecium was probably trilocular with one ovule per locule, and ovules were anatropous, probably with apical–parietal or axile placentation. Bisexual, perigoniate flowers occur in subfamilies Gymnostachydoideae, Orontioideae, Pothoideae, Monsteroideae, and Lasioideae, no genera of which have ribbed seeds, but the infructescence and stylar region of Albertarum resemble those of extant Symplocarpus (Orontioideae). The Horseshoe Canyon Formation was deposited in a delta plain setting, and like Symplocarpus, Albertarum probably grew in a wetland environment.Key words: fossil, Araceae, Symplocarpus, Albertarum, Limnobiophyllum, Mayoa.},

All these genera are markedly reduced in the salt-marsh brackish-marine and inner-neritic shallow-marine intervals.Relative abundances of foraminifera and megaspores serve to reveal transgressive and regressive cycles near the western margin of the last widespread marine transgression in the Canadian western interior.},

	abstract = {A well-exposed example of a regressive barrier island succession crops out in the Alberta badlands along the Red Deer River Valley. In the most landward (northwestern) corner of the study area, only shallow-water and subaerial deposits are represented and are dominated by tidal inlet related facies. Seaward (southeast), water depth increases and the succession is typified by open-marine beach to offshore-related facies arranged in coarsening-upward progradational sequence. Detailed sedimentologic and ichnologic analyses of this sequence have allowed for its division into three distinct environmental zones (lower, middle, and upper). The lower zone comprises a laterally diverse assemblage of storm-influenced, lower shoreface through offshore deposits. Outcrop in the northeast is dominated by thick beds of hummocky and/or swaley cross-stratified storm sand. In the southeast, storm events have only minor influence. This lower zone contains a wide diversity of well-preserved trace fossils whose distribution appears to have been influenced by gradients in wave energy, bottom stagnation, and the interplay of storm and fair-weather processes. The middle zone records deposition across an upper shoreface environment. Here, horizontal to low-angle bedding predominates, with interspersed sets of small- and large-scale cross-bedding increasing toward the top. A characteristic feature of the upper part of this zone is the lack of biogenic structures suggesting deposition in an exposed high-energy surf zone. The upper zone records intertidal to supratidal progradation of the shoreline complex. Planar-laminated sandstone forms a distinct foreshore interval above which rhizoliths and organic material become increasingly abundant, marking transition to the backshore. A significant feature of this zone is the occurrence of an intensely bioturbated interval toward the top of the foreshore.},

During this time, the shoreline of the Bearpaw Sea was forced further to the east with a buildup of continental sediments along the margins. Within the present study area, located about 10 mi. southeast of Drumheller along the Red Deer River, six separate units can be recognized in the transition zone deposits, representing: prodelta and delta front; distributory channel; beach and interdistributary bay; mudflat; open bay; and lower floodplain environments of an ancient deltaic complex. Sedimentation occurred relatively rapidly in an unstable environment, with constantly shifting streams the primary agent of transportation and deposition of sediment.The interpretations of environment and depositional processes were based on a detailed sedimentological analysis of lithology, bed morphology, sedimentary structures and vertical sequences present in the deposits. Grain size distributions, determined for the sands, in combination with sedimentary structures, showed the sediments to have been dominantly deposited under low energy conditions. A factor analysis of the grain size data produced four factors which were related to specific levels within the flow regime. Petrographic examination of the sands provided information on the source material and character of the sediment.},

	abstract = {Nine pollen assemblage zones and three subzones, based principally on angiosperms, are recognized within 840 ft. of the Upper Cretaceous Edmonton Formation of Alberta. The two marker beds, viz., the Drumheller marine tongue and the Kneehills Tuff, divide the Edmonton Formation into lower, middle and upper members. Angiosperm pollen assemblages show three major breaks within the Edmonton Formation: at the onset of the Drumheller marine tongue; at the base of the mauve-shale containing the Kneehills Tuff; and at the top of the Nevis Coal Seam. The brackish deposition of the basal Edmonton Formation followed the regression of the Campanian Bearpaw Sea. Proximity of the sea provided humidity and a paludal environment. The prevailing subtropical humid climate supported a rain-forest-type vegetation during the deposition of the lower Edmonton member. Following the deposition of the Drumheller marine tongue, many tropical and subtropical angiosperm elements disappeared. The occurrence of temperate and warm temperate elements and an increase in the number of gymnosperm and pteridophyte species indicate an influence of a humid substropical climate with a warm temperate aspect until the deposition of the mauve-shale beds. The mauve-shale containing the Kneehills Tuff, represents lacustrine deposition with cooler climate supporting a savanna-type vegetation. Elevated sources at a distance seem to have contributed conifer pollen. The benthonitic content in the sediments may be attributed to a distant volcanic activity. Above the mauve-shale, the sediments are of flood plain origin, and the pollen flora denotes a warm temperate climate. The pollen assemblage of the Edmonton Formation is comparable with that of the Maestrichtian described from Siberia and the northern central plains of the United States of America.},
