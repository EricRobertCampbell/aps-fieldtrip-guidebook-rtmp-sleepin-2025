\section{Background Information}
\subsection{Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology}

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

The Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology (RTMP) is one of the premier palaeontological institutions in the world. Located just outside the town of Drumheller, it's situated among the badlands from which many of its fossils were found and serves a dual role as both a museum and research institution.

Although it's difficult to imagine Alberta without the RTMP as a centre for palaeontological research, the museum itself is comirelatively young, having just celebrated its 40$^{\text{th}}$ anniversary. When it opened on September 15, 1985, it was innovative in a number of ways. For one, it was not situated in a major city but is instead just outside of a comparatively small town in the heart of the badlands. From the beginning, the museum itself was planned to combine public education and scientific research; offices, libraries, and fossil preparation labs were as integral parts of the design as the galleries and exhibits \parencite[Ch.~7]{spaldingDinosaursGraveyardCanadian1999}.

The museum quickly became a success, attracting more than \num{5000} visitors on opening day and \num{600000} in the first year \parencite[p.~150]{spaldingDinosaursGraveyardCanadian1999}. Since then it has continued to expange, routinely creating new exhibits and public activities for visitors to enjoy. Today more than half a million visitors visit the museum each year and it serves as a major source of tourism revenue to the region. Recent changes include the ``First Life'' gallery, showcasing Ediacaran and Cambrian life, and the redesigned Cenozoic gallery (\citetitle{RoyalTyrrellMuseum, RoyalTyrrellMuseuma}). In recent years, the museum has also begun offering adults-only events, including a Halloween-themed exploration of the collection (\citetitle{royaltyrrellmuseumofpalaeontologyDinosaursDusk}) and a question and answer session with Dr. Caleb Brown, Curator of Dinosaur Systematics and Evolution (\citetitle{royaltyrrellmuseumofpalaeontologyBonesBrews}).

While the public experiences the museum as a place to learn about palaeontolgy, it has been equally devoted to research \parencite{spaldingDinosaursGraveyardCanadian1999}. Its location, close to fossil-rich sites like Dinosaur Provincial Park (a few hours east) was chosen to keep scientists close to their field areas. As a result, the museum attracts some of the top palaeontologists in the world, both as staff and as visitors. The palaeontologists at the museum routinely publish important research, including research on tyrannosaur face biting \parencite{brownIntraspecificFacialBite2022}, ancient climates \parencite{reichgeltHumidMesothermalClimate2025}, and fish evolution \parencite{liuMarineOriginsFreshwater2025}.

\subsection{Drumheller and Surrounding Area}

Today, one of the most striking features of the area is the badlands landscape surrounding the museum. Its low-layered design and brown exterior were designed to blend into its badland surroundings \parencite[p.~149]{spaldingDinosaursGraveyardCanadian1999}. As you descend into the Red Deer river valley from the plains above, the exposed layers of sandstone, mudstone, and coal \parencite{eberthRevisedStratigraphyDepositional2012}, reveal the long geological history that make this region such an excellent place to find fossils.

    \end{subfigure}
    \hfill
    \begin{subfigure}[t]{0.48\textwidth}

    \caption{A map of what is now North America during the late Cretaceous. Note that the area around Drumheller would have been very near to the shore of the Western Interior Seaway. Image credit: Deep Time Maps™ 2020}
    \end{subfigure}
\end{figure}

These layers belong to the Horseshoe Canyon Formation (HCF), which spanned about 74 - 67 million years ago \parencite{eberthRevisedStratigraphyDepositional2012}. Although today the area surrounding the museum is a badlands, at the time that the stone was deposited the environment would have been significantly different. During the late Cretaceous sea levels were much higher and a vast inland sea, the Western Interior Seaway, divided North American into two landmasses: Laramidia to the west (including Alberta) and Appalachia to the east. The area around the museum lay close to the shifting shoreline and as sea levels rose and fell the environment would have changed: at some points being warm, wet, and tropical and at others being relatively cool and drier \parencite{quinneyPalaeoenvironmentalPalaeoclimaticReconstruction2013}. At the same time, the Rocky Mountains were being formed as parts of what is now British Columbia collided with the rest of North America \parencite{quinneyPalaeoenvironmentalPalaeoclimaticReconstruction2013}, providing abundant sediments.


The conditions of the area were perfect for fossilization. The area was largely flat and frequently contained large deltas and slow-moving, sediment-filled rivers, providing for rapid burial and fossilization \parencite{eberthRevisedStratigraphyDepositional2012}. At many points, the area around Drumheller would have resembled the swamps and bayous of modern-day Louisiana.

\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.3\textwidth}

    \label{fig:strat-chart}
\end{wrapfigure}

Below the HCF is the Bearpaw Formation, formed from marine sediments as the Western Interior Seaway rose to cover the land with water. Above it are the Battle and Scollard formations. The Scollard formation is particularly noteworthy as it contains the K-Pg extinction layer, a layer of sediment from 66 million years ago when an asteroid crashed into the area near Chixulub (Yucatan Peninsula), leading to the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs \parencite{leckieScenicGeologyAlberta2021}.

The plant and animal life would have been abundant throughout the area. Imagine huge herds of hadrosaurs like \species{Edmontosaurus} and \species{Hypacrosaurus}, ceratopsians like \species{Anchiceratops} and ankylosaurs like \species{Euplocephalus} moving through the swamps and plains. They would have been observed by large predators like the tyrannosaurs \species{Albertosaurus}, while underfoot moved smaller species like the pachycephalosaur \species{Sphaeotholus} and the dromaeosaur \species{Atrociraptor} \parencite{eberthDinosaurBiostratigraphyEdmonton2013}.

The numerous dinosaurs, while the most charismatic animals in the area, certainly weren't the only ones! Turtles, while less common than in the warmer times immediately preceding and following, are still present \parencite{brinkmanReviewNonmarineTurtles2003}. In addition, mammals like the cat-sized \species{Didelphodon}, an early relative of marsupials, have been found \parencite{foxStagodontidMarsupialsLate2006}. Fish species, relative of modern-day gars and sturgeons among other, filled the streams and rivers \parencite{larsonFaunalAssemblagesUpper2010}.

While we often focus on the animal life of the HCF, the plant fossils that can be found in the area provide a fascinating glimpse into the environment at the time. It's very common when looking at the ironstone nodules found in the area to find fragments of sticks, needles, and pinecones from the numerous conifers that occurred at the time \parencite{serbetCunninghamiaTayloriiSp2013}. These ironstone nodules formed when particles began to accumulate around an object in the swamps, leading to beautiful preservation. These nodules frequently preserve their contents in three dimensions, allowing for exquisite fossils like an aroid flower to be preserved and studied \parencite{bognerFossilizedAroidInfructescence2005}. In addition, the fossil pollens in the area have been extensively studied, allowing us to understand the diversity and patterns of change throughout the seven million years of the HCF \parencite{kutlukMegasporesUpperCretaceous2017}. The plant fossils found around the RTMP paint a picture of an evolving landscape that transitioned from dry and cool to warm, wet, and tropical, then back to a more savannah-like environment.

\end{figure}


One of the notable features of the HCF formation is that in certain areas, large bonebeds of species like \species{Edmontosaurus} or \species{Hypacrosaurus} are found \parencite{eberthRevisedStratigraphyDepositional2012, evansHadrosauridEdmontosaurusBonebeds2015}. The most famous of these is the \species{Albertosaurus} bonebed, located just north of the RTMP in Dry Island Buffalo Jump Provincial Park \parencite{eberthStratigraphySedimentologyTaphonomy2010}. This bonebed was discovered by famous fossil hunter Barnum Brown in 1910, lost, and then rediscovered in 1997 by a team from the RTMP and the Dinosaur International Society \parencite{curriePossibleEvidenceGregarious1998, spaldingDinosaursGraveyardCanadian1999}. It contains the remains of approximately 12 \species{Albertosaurus sarcophagus}, a smaller, faster relative of \species{Tyrannosaurus rex}, and may represent a family group. As terrifying as one \species{Albertosaurus} was, imagine a whole pack of them!

\end{figure}

However, in order for us to find all of these fossils, they needed to be exposed! The two main ways that new fossils are exposed around the RTMP are through the sudden erosion of the Red Deer River valley and the gradual erosion of the badlands. 

About \num{15000} years ago, much of Alberta (and the rest of Canada) was covered by glaciers more than \si{2}{km} thick \parencite[p.~170]{leckieScenicGeologyAlberta2021}. As these glaciers melted, the enormous volume of water carved deep river valleys, including the Red Deer river running through Drumheller. This exposed large portions of the fossil-rich HCF. Early fossils hunters in the area, such as Barnum Brown, routinely collected fossils by floating down the river and keeping an eye out for any exposed fossils along the riverbank or higher up in the valley \parencite[p.~47]{spaldingDinosaursGraveyardCanadian1999}. Even today it's not uncommon to find fossils while walking along the river!

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{amnh_scow.jpg}
    \caption{Barnum Brown and crew searching for fossils in the Red Deer river valley on a scow (1912).}
\end{figure}

In contrast to the (geologically) sudden carving out of the valley, the other process which exposes the fossils is erosion from wind and rain. In contrast to the humid, lush climate that would have been present 70 million years ago, the area around the RTMP today is dry and sparsely vegetated. The difficulty of making a living in this desolate climate led to the term 'badlands', but the misfortune of the early peoples in the area is a boon to palaeontologists! The lack of vegetation means that exposed fossils are easy to see, while simultaneously allowing the sparse rains in the area to erode away the solid and rock, exposing yet more fossils. The area can erode by as much as \si{4}{mm} a year \parencite{demers-potvinHighLocalVariability2025}, meaning that there is always a new crop of fossils to be found!

The area around the RTMP is one of the most extensively studied fossil sites on the planet. Thanks in large part to the museum's presence, it has become a hotbed of research on all aspects of this late-Cretaceous ecosystem, from the geology and climate on one hand to the plant and animal life on the other. Studies here have provided insights into the formation of the Rocky Mountains to the west and the Western Interior Seaway to the east. Having such extensive knowledge about this ancient ecosystem provides valuable insights into how changes in climate rippled through the interconnected web of species in the area. Even better, this treasure trove of information is publicly accessible, and in fact, a major tourist destination - a scientific legacy that we're fortunate to share in Alberta.
